\section{Introduction}

The following documentation is intended elaborate how the design of the snake game is implemented. The document will also explain how the functional and non-functional requirements mentioned in the Software Requirements Specification will be explained. This document is intended for the following readers:

\begin{itemize}
\item Designers: The document can serve to ensure that all functional and non-functional requirements are met. Further, designers can also use this document to verify any discrepancies among different modules.

\item New Project Members: This document can bring new team members up-to-date with the overview and structure of the game.

\item Maintainers: This document can also used to understand the structure of the game and all of the modules within. It would then be the responsibility of the maintainers to update the Design document by mentioning any change they have made to it.

\item Professor and TAs: As this document is being marked, the professors and TAs will have access to the document to determine if it was structured as intended. The document will also serve to give the Professor and the TAs an overview of the modules of the snake game.
\end{itemize}

The Snake game has been divided up into modules which hide information from other modules in the document in order to implement the Information Hiding principle of Software Engineering. Further, the modules only share the information amongst each other that is necessary. This is done to ensure the Low Coupling principle of Software Engineering. In order to read or modify values within different modules, there are getter and setter methods unique to the respective modules. This is done to implement the Encapsulation principle of Software Engineering.

This document consists of the Module Interface Specification (or MIS) which is intended for programmers who work to further develop the Snake Game.

The rest of this document consists of the GANTT and PERT chart meant to highlight the time frame for future deliverables for development of the Snake Game.

\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes} \label{SecChange}

There are two types of possible changes: Anticipated and Unlikely Changes. This section covers both of these changes.

\subsection{Anticipated Changes} \label{SecAchange}



\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acFood}:] The type of food which the snake eats.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acGameOver}:] What must happen after the game is over.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acMainMenu}:] More options available in the menu as game expands .e.g. save game, high scores, sound, difficulty etc.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acPlayMap}:] The map of the game.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acPowerUps}:] Different PowerUps will be available such as Intangibility (.i.e. ability to go through walls) as the game expands.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acSnake}:] The characteristics of the snake .e.g. its color, the way it grows, the speed at which it moves etc.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acInput}:] Addition or modification of Keyboard and mouse commands as game is expanded in the future.
\end{description}

\subsection{Unlikely Changes} \label{SecUchange}

These are design decisions that have to be changed after they were fixed in the software architecture state (in order to simplify the design). It wasn't intended that these decisions would have to be changed.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucIO}:] Input/Output devices
  (Input: Keyboard, Mouse Output: Screen).
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucPygame}:] The game will always be implemented in python using the Pygame library.
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucGoal}:] The goal of the game is to get the highest score possible.
\end{description}

\section{Module Hierarchy} \label{SecMH}

This section lists the modules in the Snake game. The modules listed below are leaves in the module hierarchy in the table below. 

\begin{description}
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mFood}:] Food Module
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mGameOver}:] GameOver Module
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mMainMenu}:] MainMenu Module
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mPlayMap}:] PlayMap Module
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mPowerUp}:] PowerUp Module
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mSnake}:] Snake Module
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mController}:] Controller Module
\end{description}

The Hardware-Hiding Module is already implemented by the operating system and hence will not be reimplemented.

\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}

The table below highlights the connection between the system requirements(which are listed in the Software Requirements Specification) and the modules.

\section{Module Decomposition} \label{SecMD}

Modules are decomposed according to the principle of ``information hiding''
proposed by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}. The \emph{Secrets} field in a module
decomposition is a brief statement of the design decision hidden by the
module. The \emph{Services} field specifies \emph{what} the module will do
without documenting \emph{how} to do it. For each module, a suggestion for the
implementing software is given under the \emph{Implemented By} title. If the
entry is \emph{OS}, this means that the module is provided by the operating
system or by standard programming language libraries. If the entry is
\emph{Matlab}, this means that the module is provided by Matlab.  \emph{SWHS} means the
module will be implemented by the SWHS software.  
% should reference a command for the name, in case it changes
Only the leaf modules in the
hierarchy have to be implemented. If a dash (\emph{--}) is shown, this means
that the module is not a leaf and will not have to be implemented. Whether or
not this module is implemented depends on the programming language
selected.

\subsection{Hardware Hiding Modules (\mref{mHH})}

\begin{description}
\item[Secrets:]The data structure and algorithm used to implement the virtual
  hardware.
\item[Services:]Serves as a virtual hardware used by the rest of the
  system. This module provides the interface between the hardware and the
  software. So, the system can use it to display outputs or to accept inputs.

\subsection{Behaviour-Hiding Module}

\begin{description}
\item[Secrets:]The contents of the required behaviors.
\item[Services:]Includes programs that provide externally visible behavior of

  documents. This module serves as a communication layer between the
  hardware-hiding module and the software decision module. The programs in this
  module will need to change if there are changes in the SRS.
