Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan

 - The graphical implementation of the game might be difficult because PyGame is something
   that we have to familiarize ourselves with
 - Testing for the backend classes will not be difficult because PyUnit provides comprehensive testing tools for us
 - Testing the graphical aspect will be bit more difficult as we need to create game states
   with expected input and output, and manually go through and perform the actions
 - Testing the end product will the most difficult of all because we must conduct user testing, in which case we will
   probably have to take into account ease of use, enjoyability, and other qualitative comments (also must find people willing to test for us)
 
- most difficult part of implementation will be applying the MVC model and modularizing the code
 	-> code is very simple atm, with no structure, so organizing it will mean completely redesigning 

 - pygame requires that you have a 32-bit version of python, may cause some people problems

 - Portability will be a concern because we cannot package the game as an executable file
	- also, because Python AND PyGame is required to run the game, portability is low
	  (unlike HTML implementation where anyone can run it from their browser)
