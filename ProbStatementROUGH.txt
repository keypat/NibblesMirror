What problem are you trying to solve?
	- The problem I am trying to solve is the user's boredom.
	- The problem is that the bored or procrastinating user wants to engage their mind in a fun way.
	- The problem we are trying to solve is to improve the maintainability, reusability, and ________(from the first sheet we handed in)
	  of the original project

Why is this an important problem?
	- because people like to be challenged and engage in activities that develop skills like organization, timing, strategic planning, forward thinking
	  without the activities being boring or tedious
	- It's important because games can help distract the user from daily stress, or help unwind at the end of a hard day.

What is the context of the problem you are solving?
	- The scope is restricted to an open source version of the classic Snake game
	- The current state of the game lacks any GUI wrapper for the game
	- current state of the game is such that the data is not modularized so reusability and maintainability of the game is not an option
	- We want to add some extra features to increase entertainment value and add mechanics which promote 
	  forward thinking(planning a few steps ahead) and decision making with restricted time
